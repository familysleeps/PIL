##  Inclusion criteria for families with an autistic child
 
In order to take part in this study you and your family need to meet the following criteria:

*  Give informed consent (for adults) or assent (for children) to take part in the study 
*  Have one child aged 6-10 years old on the 01/06/2025 with a clinical diagnosis of autism according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or International Classification of Diseases 11th revision (ICD-11) diagnostic criteria for autism. This diagnosis must be verified by a clinical report (relevant assessments can include clinical observations, caregiver history, self-report, behavioural assessments, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R)). These reports will be reviewed by a psychiatrist, who will provide clinical confirmation of each family’s eligibility for participation   
* Have one non-autistic child aged between 6-10 years old on the 01/06/2025   
* All family members must have stable medical and behavioural conditions e.g. treated asthma, diabetes etc.  
* Your family must be located in the Republic of Ireland
