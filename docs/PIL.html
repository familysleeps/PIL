<h2>Research Study Information Sheets</h2>
<p> </p>
<div id="study-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Study Overview</h3>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this
information sheet carefully and discuss it with your family if you wish.
Take your time to read it and don’t feel under any pressure to decide
right away. It is important for you to understand the study fully before
you decide to participate or not. If anything is unclear to you, or if
you have any questions at all about the study, please don’t hesitate to
get in touch with us by email (<a href="mailto:familysleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">familysleeps@mu.ie</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="why-are-we-doing-this-research-study" class="section level4">
<h4>Why are we doing this research study?</h4>
<p>Circadian rhythms are bodily and behavioural changes that follow a
24-hour cycle. Circadian rhythms regulate important biological processes
in our bodies, such as sleep. Neurodevelopmental conditions are a group
of conditions that affect the brain. Disturbed circadian rhythms and
sleep are a feature of many neurodevelopmental conditions in adults and
children. Our overall aim at the Family Genomics research group at
Maynooth University is to investigate the reasons for this.</p>
<p>In order to do this work, we first need to measure sleep and
circadian rhythms in families with autistic children and in families
with non-autistic children. This will help us to understand if there are
any differences in sleep patterns and circadian rhythms between families
with autistic children and families with non-autistic children. We will
also get saliva samples from each family member to look at your genes in
order to understand the link between your genes, autism, sleep and
circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>The overall aim of this study is to investigate the link between
sleep, circadian rhythms and genetics in 30 families with autistic
children and 30 families with non-autistic children.</p>

</div>
<div id="why-am-i-being-asked-to-take-part-in-this-research-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h4>
<p>We have asked you to take part because you are a parent of at least
two non-autistic children aged 6-10 years old or you are a parent of at
least one non-autistic child aged 6-10 years old and one autistic child
aged 6-10 years old, and because you are willing to help us to
investigate sleep and circadian rhythms in families.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-have-to-take-part" class="section level4">
<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
<p>It is important to know that you, your family, and your children do
not have to take part in this study if you do not wish to. You and/or
your children can change your minds about participating in this study at
any time, even after the study has begun. If you and/or your children
decide that you do not want to participate, this will have no effect on
your or their current or future participation in any other research
studies. You and/or your children do not have to provide a reason for
deciding not to participate or changing your mind. If you or your child
wish to opt out at any point, please contact Dr Lorna Lopez (Study
email: <a href="mailto:familysleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">familysleeps@mu.ie</a>), the lead investigator of this
study and she will be able to organise this for you.</p>

<h4>Is there any reason that I might not be eligible to
participate?</h4>
<p>We have a list of reasons why some families might not be eligible to
participate in this particular study. These reasons are listed at the
end of this document. Please take time to read through them. Whether or
not you decide or are eligible to participate, we really appreciate each
family’s interest and the time you have taken to engage with us.</p>

<h4>Is it okay to opt out of some parts of the study?</h4>
<p>We need participants to complete all parts of the study so if you or
your child are not happy with everything then you will not be eligible
to participate. We are happy to discuss any concerns or queries that you
may have before you agree to participate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-the-study-be-carried-out" class="section level4">
<h4>How will the study be carried out?</h4>
<p>We will give you a research kit that includes written instructions
and all materials and equipment needed to complete the study and we will
always be available to answer any questions you have about the
study.</p>
<p>You will be asked to do the following tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put a wrist-worn activity monitor on each parent and two children
(this will be worn day and night) and supervise wear for 2 weeks every 3
months, so 4 times during the study. We will ask you to remove your
child’s wrist-worn activity monitor before coming into contact with
water, such as when bathing or swimming, and put it back on as soon as
possible afterwards. This will be easy to remove and replace as
necessary. The device will monitor movement continuously throughout the
day and night. The device will only monitor movement. Below is an
example of the wrist-worn activity monitor each family member will wear
for 2 weeks in months 3, 6, 9 and 12.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/r.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br><br> <!-- Add two line breaks --></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put sensors that monitor movement in your children’s bedroom(s) for
12 months. A parent or caregiver will be asked to fit this sensor in the
child’s bedroom. Below is an example of the sensor that will be placed
in each child’s bedroom. If you require assistance with the watch or the
installation of the bedside sensor at any stage, you can contact the
team at <a href="mailto:familysleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">familysleeps@mu.ie</a> or 087 1998589. This sensor will
also collect information about your child’s sleep environment, e.g.,
light, air quality and temperature, noise. If you and your child go on
holiday or stay somewhere else overnight, we will ask you to bring their
bedside sensor, if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/somnofy.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br><br> <!-- Add two line breaks --></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Complete some questionnaires about you and your children’s sleep
and sleep preferences. Only parents/guardians will complete these
questionnaires. No children will ever be asked to complete
questionnaires. Five questionnaires will be completed at baseline, and
then three at four time points during the 12-month study (nineteen
questionnaires completed over the 12 months). Questionnaires will take
approximately 15 minutes each to complete. Sleep diaries will be filled
in every day for each two-week period that you are wearing the
wrist-worn monitor.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a saliva sample for each parent and two children and
return them to us using a method of your choice that we will pay for.
Full instruction will be included in the saliva collection kits that we
will post to you and if you require any additional assistance, you can
contact the team at <a href="mailto:familysleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">familysleeps@mu.ie</a> or 087 199 8589. These samples will
be used to examine each family members DNA. Each person’s DNA contains
information about their unique genetic code. We will collect and analyse
each family member’s unique genetic information to research within and
between families for genetic links between different traits and
health-related characteristics such as family-relatedness (sibling),
sex, chronotype (certain times they prefer to sleep or are more alert)
and autism.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a report that verifies your child’s clinical diagnosis of
autism if this is applicable to your family. This only applies to
families with a child with a clinical diagnosis of autism. The details
of this report will be kept entirely confidential and securely stored in
a password protected folder in Maynooth University. Only members of our
research team will have access to the details of this report. The report
will be reviewed by a member of our team who is an experienced
clinician, who will verify your child’s clinical diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p>Return the sensors (wrist worn activity monitor and bedside
sensor) to us using a method of your choice that we will pay
for.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Your child will be asked to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wear a wrist worn activity monitor for two weeks at four timepoints
over one year (3,6,9, and 12 months).</li>
<li>Assent to the placement of the sensor in their bedroom for one
year.</li>
<li>Give a saliva sample for the purpose of DNA extraction.</li>
</ol>

<div id="what-will-happen-to-me-if-i-agree-to-take-part"
class="section level4">
<h4>What will happen to me if I agree to take part?</h4>
<p>After you have read this information sheet, and if you decide that
the study is something you and your family would still be interested in,
we will have a short conversation over the phone to ensure that you and
your family are eligible to participate. We will then ask you to give
written consent to participate by post or email and then we will arrange
times and methods for us to deliver the sensors and saliva kits. These
can be at times and places that are convenient for you. Participation
may involve online or face-to-face meetings or written correspondence in
accordance with your preference. You will have the names and contact
details of the researchers who you can contact at any time during the
study, should you have any questions. We will contact you again by a
method of your choice to collect the questionnaire data that you have
completed. We will give you clear written and/or verbal instructions on
how to fit the sensors and perform the other tests, and we encourage you
to contact us at any time with questions.</p>

class="section level4">
<h4>Are there any benefits to me or my family if I take part in the
study?</h4>
<p>There will be no direct benefit from participating in this research.
Taking part will help us to understand more about the relationship
between sleep and circadian rhythms and genetics in families. We will
not feedback any of your family’s individual results for any part of the
study. We will post your child some stickers at the end of every month
to thank them for their continued help with our research.</p>

</div>
<div id="will-i-be-given-any-results-of-my-sleep-studies"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will I be given any results of my sleep studies?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t give you the results of any of the tests we
do to measure sleep in you or in your children. Knowing these
measurements might unconsciously affect your own sleep and your child’s
sleep. This could then affect the results of our study, and we might end
up making an incorrect conclusion. However, we will show you data on
sleep from children in general, if you are interested. You will also be
able to see summary data when we publish our results, but it will not be
possible to identify the data that relates to your child.</p>

id="are-there-any-risks-to-me-or-others-if-i-take-part-in-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Are there any risks to me or others if I take part in the
study?</h4>
<p>We have taken great care to identify and address any potential safety
concerns, and we do not consider that taking part presents a risk to the
participants. There is a small possibility that you or your child might
develop skin irritation from the wrist worn activity monitor, and we
will ask you to be vigilant to this, and to remove the strap immediately
if signs of irritation are detected. If you are unsure about anything,
please feel free to contact our research team at <a
href="mailto:familysleeps@mu.ie" class="email">familysleeps@mu.ie</a> or

<div id="what-information-about-me-will-be-used-as-part-of-this-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>What information about me will be used as part of this study?</h4>
<p>With your consent, when we enrol you in the study, we will record
your name, age, date of birth (DOB), sex, address, and contact details
(email and phone number). We will use your contact details to contact
you about the research study, and not for any other reason. We will
record your child’s name, sex, age (DOB), and clinical diagnosis (if
applicable).</p>
<p>For families with an autistic child, we will ask you to provide a
clinical report from a psychiatrist or psychologist to confirm your
child’s diagnosis of autism. We will keep a copy of this report for the
purpose of clinical verification by a member of the team that is an
experienced clinician. Following verification and study completion, we
will destroy this stored report. However, we will retain your child’s
clinical information e.g., confirmed diagnosis of autism. This
information will be retained in anonymised form – we will not be able to
link it back to your child’s name or your family’s details.</p>
<p>As soon as you and your family have enrolled in the study, you will
be assigned a unique study ID code - this is called pseudonymisation.
Any information we gather from that point (sensor data, genetic data and
questionnaire data) will be associated with the ID code and not with
your names. This is not only for electronically stored data. For
example, physical copies of questionnaires, and the saliva sample each
family member provides for DNA analysis will be labelled with your
unique study IDs and not your names. Only the authorised research team
at Maynooth University will have access to the ‘key’ that links your
name to your ID code, and this information will be stored on an
encrypted file on a password protected computer at Maynooth University.
Neither your name nor ID code will be used when reporting the results of
this research for publication or presentation; your contribution will be
entirely anonymous.</p>
<p>Over the 12 months we will record questionnaire data for your family
at four timepoints, we will record daily movement data for each family
member using the wrist worn activity monitors, we will record movement
and sleep data in each child’s bedroom using the bedside sensor, and we
will record genetic data for each family member using the saliva samples
you provide. The purpose of collecting this data is to help us to better
understand the link between sleep, circadian rhythms and genes in
families.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-will-happen-to-my-personal-data" class="section level4">
<h4>What will happen to my personal data?</h4>
<p>The personal information that we will collect are your name, age
(DOB), sex, address and contact details (phone number and email
address), sensor data, and genetic data. Your name, age (DOB), address
and contact details will be stored on an encrypted file on a password
protected computer at Maynooth University that can only be accessed by
the research team at Maynooth University. All other data will be stored
on separate encrypted files on a password protected computer at Maynooth
University and will be linked to your family’s unique study ID and not
your names. These data files will only be accessible by the research
team in Maynooth University. This means that no one outside of the
research team at Maynooth University can link your sensor, genetic and
questionnaire data back to you and/or your family.</p>
<p>We will use your Eircode to identify your small area ID of your home
in order to assess your socioeconomic position. We will link your
Eircode to the Pobal HP Deprivation index, which is scale developed by
the government to categorise the affluence of regions of the Republic of
Ireland. We will use this information test known associations between
sleep and social deprivation. The small area ID cannot identify your
actual address just the region in which you live, and we will not store
your Eircode in our research dataset – this will only be stored for the
purposes of contacting you and will be deleted at the end of the
study.</p>
<p>Your child’s pseudonymised (not linked to their or your name or
contact details) date of birth, sex and sensor data will be shared with
a third-party service provider (Vital Things) during the study. They
will never have access to your or your child’s name, address or contact
information. This information will be used to calculate your child’s
movement and sleep over the 12 months of the study. Vital Things will
not share this information with anyone outside of the research team.
Following completion of the study, they will destroy your child’s sensor
information, sex and age. We will store this data indefinitely in
Maynooth University so that it can be used in future research and/or for
teaching purposes (for example, student projects).</p>
<p>The pseudonymised questionnaire data (not linked to your name or
contact details) will be shared with a third-party service provider
(onlinesurveys.ac.uk) during the study. They will never have access to
your or your child’s name, address or contact information. In relation
to your questionnaire data. Onlinesurveys.ac.uk will have access to your
and your child’s names only in relation to any consent or assent forms
completed on this platform. All survey data will be retained and hosted
on a third-party (Online Surveys) server and not an Maynooth University
server.</p>
<p>The pseudonymised saliva samples each family member provides will be
sent to a university approved third-party service provider for DNA
extraction. This extracted DNA will then be sent to another university
approved third-party service provider, where they will analyse your DNA.
No genetic information resulting from this analysis will be shared with
anyone outside of the research team at Maynooth University. All saliva
samples and DNA samples will be destroyed by incineration following
analysis. The third-party service providers conducting the DNA
extraction and DNA analysis will not have access to your name, address
or contact information but we will send them the biological sex of each
person that provided a sample.</p>
<p>Following completion of the study or withdrawal from the study, your
identifiable personal information including your name, address and
contact details will be destroyed. All other data (sensor, genetic, and
questionnaire data) will then be anonymised (it will no longer be linked
back to you or your family), and it will not be possible for us or
anyone to identify you. For this reason, we cannot return any of your
data and you will not be able to request access, or to make any
amendments after the data are anonymised. This anonymised data will be
held in Maynooth University indefinitely.</p>
<p>If you choose to withdraw before the anonymisation processes, we will
remove all of your data, where possible, from the study, including your
sensor, genetic and questionnaire data. Electronic copies of data will
be overwritten, and hard copies will be destroyed by incineration.
Biological samples will be destroyed by incineration.</p>

provider will not share this data with anyone outside of the research
team in Maynooth University.</p>
<p>Third party processors will also carry out DNA extraction from the
saliva samples and will analyse the genetic information contained in
each DNA sample. They will not share this information with anyone
outside of the research team at Maynooth University. They will not
retain this information following analysis.</p>
<p>Third party processors will collect consent and assent forms and
questionnaire data (onlinesurveys.ac.uk) and sensor data (VitalThings)
but they will not share this information with anyone outside of the
research team at Maynooth University. They will not retain this
information following analysis. All survey data will be retained and
hosted on a third-party (Online Surveys) server and not an Maynooth
University server</p>

class="section level4">
<h4>Will my personal data be kept confidential?</h4>
<p>Your personal information will be kept entirely confidential, and we
will exercise our duties in handling your personal data as per the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-my-privacy-and-my-childs-privacy-be-protected"
class="section level4">
<h4>How will my privacy and my child’s privacy be protected?</h4>
<p>Protecting your privacy is extremely important to all the research
team members at Maynooth University. Personal Identifiers, such as your
name or email are never used to label your questionnaires, sensor data
or saliva samples. All data will be stored on password protected files
on a secure network in Maynooth University. No one outside of the
research team in Maynooth University will have access to your contact
information and all other data will be labelled with your unique study
ID.</p>
<p>Although all measures will be taken to protect your privacy, there is
a remote risk that a connection to your contact details could be made,
e.g., through unauthorised access to servers at Maynooth University. To
minimise this risk, any files containing these data are password
protected and have restricted access. Any attempt to identify you in
this manner would be a legal breach against the permitted use of the
research data.</p>
<p>When you have returned the sensors, questionnaires, and samples, and
the study is complete, your contact details will be incinerated in the
case of written records, and electronic data will be reformatted or
overwritten by the research team at Maynooth University and all data
will be anonymous.</p>

<div
id="will-my-personal-data-andor-sensor-data-be-used-in-future-studies"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will my personal data and/or sensor data be used in future
studies?</h4>
<p>The data we collect will be anonymised once the sensors, samples and
questionnaires have been returned, so it will not be possible for
anyone, including the research team to identify the participants from
the datasets. With your consent, we will retain these anonymous datasets
indefinitely. These datasets may be used in teaching or research.</p>

<p>If your child is not happy to wear a wrist worn sensor you will not
be eligible to participate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-if-you-miss-a-day" class="section level4">
<h4>What if you miss a day?</h4>
<p>If you miss a day of wearing the sensor, or of using the bedroom
sensor, please just continue as normal as soon as possible. If you miss
more than 2 days, then please let us know.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-lawful-basis-to-use-my-personal-data"
class="section level4">
<h4>What is the lawful basis to use my personal data?</h4>
<p>As part of the study you/your child’s personal data will only be used
for scientific research which is in the public interests (Article 6 (e)
and Article 9( 2) (j) of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-my-rights" class="section level4">
<h4>What are my rights?</h4>
<p>Under the GDPR, you are entitled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access to your data and receive a copy of it.</li>
<li>The right to restrict or object to processing of your data.</li>
<li>The right to object to any further processing of the information we
hold about you (except where it is de-identified).</li>
<li>The right to have inaccurate information about you corrected or
deleted.</li>
<li>The right to receive your data in a portable format and to have it
transferred to another data controller.</li>
<li>The right to request deletion of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rights to access to your data are forfeit in this study by the
complete anonymisation of the data. Complete anonymisation is to protect
the privacy and data security of the participants, but it also means
that it is impossible for you to access your data for any reason. We
will not record the identity of the participants that provided any
specific item of data, so we will not be able to give you access to your
data or to make any amendments.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that, in some circumstances, confidentiality of
research data and records may be overridden by courts in the event of
litigation or in the course of investigation by lawful authority. In
such circumstances the University will take all reasonable steps within
law to ensure that confidentiality is maintained to the greatest
possible extent.</p>

(you will not be identified in any publication) as well as in
information designed for parents. You can keep up to date with all
developments and activities about the study on our website. We will not
send you information about the study after your role as a participant
