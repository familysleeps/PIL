<div id="study-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Study Overview</h3>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this
information sheet carefully and discuss it with your family if you wish.
Take your time to read it and don’t feel under any pressure to decide
right away. It is important for you to understand the study fully before
you decide whether you want to participate or not. If anything is
unclear to you, or if you have any questions at all about the study,
please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us by email (<a
href="mailto:family.sleeps@mu.ie" class="email">family.sleeps@mu.ie</a>)
or phone (086 164 5998).</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="why-are-we-doing-this-research-study" class="section level4">
<h4>Why are we doing this research study?</h4>
<p>The overall aim of this study is to investigate the link between
sleep, circadian rhythms and genetics in 30 families with autistic
children and 30 families with non-autistic children.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are bodily and behavioural changes that follow a
24-hour cycle. Circadian rhythms regulate important biological processes
in our bodies, such as sleep. Neurodevelopmental conditions are a group
of conditions that affect the brain. Disturbed circadian rhythms and
sleep are a feature of many neurodevelopmental conditions in adults and
children. Our overall aim at the Family Genomics research group at
Maynooth University is to investigate the reasons for this.</p>
<p>In order to do this work, we first need to measure sleep and
circadian rhythms in families with autistic children and in families
with non-autistic children. This will help us to understand if there are
any differences in sleep patterns and circadian rhythms between families
with autistic children and families with non-autistic children. We will
also get saliva samples from each family member to look at your genes in
order to understand the link between your genes, autism, sleep and
circadian rhythms.</p>

</div>
<div id="why-am-i-being-asked-to-take-part-in-this-research-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h4>
<p>We have asked you to take part because you are a parent of at least
two non-autistic children aged 6-10 years old or you are a parent of at
least one non-autistic child aged 6-10 years old and one autistic child
aged 6-10 years old, and because you are willing to help us to
investigate sleep and circadian rhythms in families.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="do-i-have-to-take-part" class="section level4">
<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
<p>It is important to know that you, your family, and your children do
not have to take part in this study if you do not wish to. You and/or
your children can change your minds about participating in this study at
any time, even after the study has begun. If you and/or your children
decide that you do not want to participate, this will have no effect on
your or their current or future participation in any other research
studies. You and/or your children do not have to provide a reason for
deciding not to participate or changing your mind. If you or your child
wish to opt out at any point, please contact Prof Lorna Lopez (Study
email: <a href="mailto:family.sleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">family.sleeps@mu.ie</a>), the lead investigator of this
study, and she will be able to organise this for you.</p>

<h4>Is there any reason that I might not be eligible to
participate?</h4>
<p>We have a list of reasons why some families might not be eligible to
participate in this particular study. These reasons are listed in the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Please take time to read through them.
Whether or not you decide or are eligible to participate, we really
appreciate each family’s interest and the time you have taken to engage
with us.</p>

<h4>Is it okay to opt out of some parts of the study?</h4>
<p>We need participants to complete all parts of the study so if you or
your child are not happy with everything then you will not be eligible
to participate. We are happy to discuss any concerns or queries that you
may have before you agree to participate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-the-study-be-carried-out" class="section level4">
<h4>How will the study be carried out?</h4>
<p>We will give you a research kit that includes written instructions
and all materials and equipment needed to complete the study and we will
always be available to answer any questions you have about the
study.</p>
<p>You will be asked to do the following tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put a wrist-worn activity monitor on each parent and two children
(this will be worn day and night) and supervise wear for 2 weeks every 3
months, so 4 times during the study. We will ask you to remove the
wrist-worn activity monitor before coming into contact with water, such
as when bathing or swimming, and put it back on as soon as possible
afterwards. This will be easy to remove and replace as necessary. The
device will monitor movement continuously throughout the day and night.
The device will only monitor movement. Below is an example of the
wrist-worn activity monitor each family member will wear for 2 weeks in
months 3, 6, 9 and 12.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/r.png" width="818" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br><br> <!-- Add two line breaks --></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put sensors that monitor movement in one of your children’s bedroom
for 12 months. A parent or caregiver will be asked to fit this sensor in
the child’s bedroom. Below is an example of the sensor that will be
placed in your child’s bedroom. If you require assistance with the watch
or the installation of the bedside sensor at any stage, you can contact
the team at <a href="mailto:family.sleeps@mu.ie"
class="email">family.sleeps@mu.ie</a> or 086 164 5998 . This sensor will
also collect information about your child’s sleep environment, e.g.,
light, noise, air quality and temperature. If you and your child go on
holiday or stay somewhere else overnight, we will ask you to bring their
bedside sensor, if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/somnofy.png" width="818" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br><br> <!-- Add two line breaks --></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Complete some questionnaires about you and your children’s sleep
and sleep preferences. Only parents will complete these questionnaires.
No children will ever be asked to complete questionnaires. One
questionnaire will be completed at baseline, and then four at four time
points during the 12-month study. Questionnaires will take approximately
15 minutes each to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a saliva sample for each parent and each participating
child and return them to us using a method of your choice that we will
pay for. Full instructions will be included in the saliva collection
kits that we will post to you and if you require any additional
assistance, you can contact the team at <a
href="mailto:family.sleeps@mu.ie" class="email">family.sleeps@mu.ie</a>
or 086 164 5998 . These samples will be used to examine each family
member’s DNA. Each person’s DNA contains information about their unique
genetic code. We will collect and analyse each family member’s unique
genetic information to research within and between families for genetic
links between different traits and health-related characteristics such
as family-relatedness (sibling), sex, chronotype (certain times they
prefer to sleep or are more alert) and autism.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a report that verifies your child’s clinical diagnosis of
autism if this is applicable to your family. This only applies to
families with a child with a clinical diagnosis of autism. The details
of this report will be kept entirely confidential and securely stored in
a password protected folder in Maynooth University. Only members of our
research team will have access to the details of this report. The report
will be reviewed by a member of our team who is an experienced
clinician, who will verify your child’s clinical diagnosis. All persons
having access are bound by a professional code and/or contractual
obligation of secrecy/confidentiality.</p></li>
<li><p>Return the sensors (wrist worn activity monitor and bedside
sensor) at the end of data collection to us using a method of your
choice that we will pay for.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Your child will be asked to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Wear a wrist worn activity monitor for two weeks at four timepoints
over one year (3,6,9, and 12 months).</li>
<li>Assent to the placement of the sensor in their bedroom for one year
(if applicable).</li>
<li>Give a saliva sample for the purpose of DNA extraction.</li>

<div id="what-will-happen-to-me-if-i-agree-to-take-part"
class="section level4">
<h4>What will happen to me if I agree to take part?</h4>
<p>After you have read this information sheet, and if you decide that
the study is something you and your family would still be interested in,
we will have a 50-60 minute conversation over the phone/Microsoft Teams
to answer any questions you might have. We will then ask you to give
written consent to participate by post, email, or online and then we
will arrange times and methods for us to deliver the sensors and saliva
kits. These can be at times and places that are convenient for you, or
the kits will be posted to you. Participation may involve online or
face-to-face meetings or written correspondence in accordance with your
preference. You will have the names and contact details of the
researchers who you can contact at any time during the study, should you
have any questions. We will contact you again by a method of your choice
to collect the questionnaire data that you have completed. We will give
you clear written and/or verbal instructions on how to fit the sensors
and perform the other tests, and we encourage you to contact us at any
time with questions.</p>

class="section level4">
<h4>Are there any benefits to me or my family if I take part in the
study?</h4>
<p>There will be no direct benefit from participating in this research.
Taking part will help us to understand more about the relationship
between sleep and circadian rhythms and genetics in families. We will
not feedback any of your family’s individual results for any part of the
study, so as to prevent you from (consciously or unconsciously) altering
your or your child’s behaviour based on the information.<br />
You might wonder whether incidental findings could potentially be
revealed via genetic information (e.g., the genetic analysis might find
a genetic condition). However, as we will only look at the parts of your
DNA that are relevant for our study purposes, our analyses will not
reveal any possible incidental findings. Therefore, there are no direct
health effects for you or your family members from taking part in this
study. There are no medical students on the research team.</p>
<p>We will post your child an engagement booklet with every study pack
to thank them for their continued help with our research.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-benefits-to-the-research-team"
class="section level4">
<h4>What are the benefits to the research team?</h4>
<p>First and foremost, this research study is the first longitudinal
investigation into circadian rhythm synchronisation in families with an
autistic child. This will allow us to get an understanding of the
correlation and sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in autistic
individuals, which, in turn, will help guide the development of
interventions aimed to improve the quality of life of autistic
individuals and their families.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study findings will be published in an academic
journal. Furthermore, the study will form part of the PhD Nominee’s, Mr
Aung Myat Phyo, PhD thesis, which means it will help him obtain a PhD
qualification.</p>

</div>
<div id="will-i-be-given-any-results-of-my-sleep-studies"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will I be given any results of my sleep studies?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t give you the results of any of the tests we
do to measure sleep in you or in your children. Knowing these
measurements might unconsciously affect your own sleep and your child’s
sleep. This could then affect the results of our study, and we might end
up making an incorrect conclusion. However, we will show you data on
sleep from children in general, if you are interested. You will also be
able to see summary data when we publish our results, but it will not be
possible to identify the data that relates to your child.</p>
<p> </p>

<div
id="are-there-any-risks-to-me-or-others-if-i-take-part-in-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Are there any risks to me or others if I take part in the
study?</h4>
<p>We have taken great care to identify and address any potential safety
concerns, and we do not consider that taking part presents a risk to the
participants. There is a small possibility that you or your child might
develop skin irritation from the wrist worn activity monitor, and we
will ask you to be vigilant to this, and to remove the strap immediately
if signs of irritation are detected. Please be assured that arrangements
are in place so that personal data will be processed in a way that
limits damages and/or distress to you and your family. If you are unsure
about anything, please feel free to contact our research team at <a
href="mailto:family.sleeps@mu.ie" class="email">family.sleeps@mu.ie</a>
or 086 164 5998 at any time.</p>

<div id="what-information-about-me-will-be-used-as-part-of-this-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>What information about me will be used as part of this study?</h4>
<p>With your consent, when we enrol you in the study, we will record
your name, age, date of birth (DOB), sex, address, and contact details
(email and phone number). We will use your contact details to contact
you about the research study, and not for any other reason. We will
record your children’s names, sexes, and ages (DOB,.</p>
<p>For families with an autistic child, we will ask you to provide a
clinical report from a psychiatrist or psychologist to confirm your
child’s diagnosis of autism. We will keep a copy of this report for the
purpose of clinical verification by a member of the team that is an
experienced clinician. Following verification, we will destroy this
stored report. However, we will retain your child’s clinical information
e.g., confirmed diagnosis of autism. This information will be retained
in pseudonymised form – we will not be able to link it back to your
child’s name or your family’s details.</p>
<p>As soon as you and your family have enrolled in the study, you will
be assigned a unique study ID code - this is called pseudonymisation.
Any information we gather from that point (sensor data, genetic data and
questionnaire data) will be associated with the unique ID code and not
with your names. This is not only for electronically stored data. For
example, physical copies of questionnaires, and the saliva sample each
family member provides for DNA analysis will be labelled with your
unique study IDs and not your names. Only the authorised research team
at Maynooth University will have access to the ‘key’ that links your
name to your ID code, and this information will be stored on an
encrypted file on a password protected computer at Maynooth University.
Neither your name nor ID code will be used when reporting the results of
this research for publication or presentation; your contribution will be
entirely anonymous.</p>
<p>Over the 12 months we will record questionnaire data for your family
at four timepoints, we will record daily movement data for each family
member using the wrist worn activity monitors for 14 days at four
timepoints, we will record movement and sleep data in one of your
children’s bedroom using the bedside sensor, and we will record genetic
data for each family member using the saliva samples you provide. The
purpose of collecting this data is to help us better understand the link
between sleep, circadian rhythms and genes in families.</p>

<div id="what-will-happen-to-my-personal-data" class="section level4">
<h4>What will happen to my personal data?</h4>
<p>Some of the data FamilySleeps collects from participants are
considered <strong>special category data</strong> under General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), since it is classed as genetic data.
Because this data can be linked to your identity it is considered
particularly sensitive and should therefore be treated as high-risk
data. This means we must meet certain requirements in order to process
your data safely. In line with these requirements, we will be asking for
your explicit consent to use your data in the ways outlined in this
information sheet. In order for you to provide us with explicit consent,
<strong>please read all of this information sheet</strong> so that you
can decide whether you are happy with how we would use your data.</p>
<p>The personal information that we will collect are your name, age
(DOB), sex, address and contact details (phone number and email
address), sensor data, and genetic data. Your name, age (DOB), address
and contact details will be stored on an encrypted file on a password
protected computer at Maynooth University that can only be accessed by
the research team at Maynooth University. All other data will be stored
on separate encrypted files on a password protected computer at Maynooth
University and will be linked to your family’s unique study ID and not
your names. These data files will only be accessible by the research
team in Maynooth University.</p>
<p>We will use your Eircode to identify your small area ID of your home
in order to assess your socioeconomic position. We will link your small
area ID to the Pobal HP Deprivation Index, which is a scale developed by
the government to categorise the affluence of regions of the Republic of
Ireland. We will use this information to test known associations between
sleep and social deprivation. The small area ID cannot identify your
actual address just the region in which you live, and we will not store
your Eircode in our research dataset – this will only be stored for the
purposes of contacting you.</p>
<p>Your child’s pseudonymised (not linked to their or your name or
contact details) date of birth, sex and sensor data will be shared with
a third-party service provider (Vital Things) during the study. They
will never have access to your or your child’s name, address or contact
information. This information will be used to calculate your child’s
movement and sleep over the 12 months of the study. Vital Things will
not share this information with anyone outside of the research team.
Following completion of the study, they will destroy all your child’s
data (i.e., sensor information, sex and age). As per ethics guidelines,
we will store this data for 10 years after completion of the study in
Maynooth University. Under GDPR, the data cannot be used for future
research and/or teaching purposes, student projects, joining a biobank
or other type of mixed dataset without additional ethical approval and
additional consent from you for the specific purposes. No future uses of
the data are currently planned. If any secondary use of the data
collected during the study is to occur, we will ensure that it is done
in accordance with GDPR and other relevant regulations. This includes
obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Committee (REC) to ensure
that all ethical standards are maintained.</p>
<p>The pseudonymised questionnaire data (not linked to your name or
contact details) will be shared with a third-party service provider
(onlinesurveys.ac.uk) during the study. They will never have access to
your or your child’s name, address or contact information in relation to
your questionnaire data. Onlinesurveys.ac.uk will have access to your
and your child’s names only in relation to any consent or assent forms
completed on this platform. All survey data will be retained and hosted
on a third-party (Online Surveys) server and not a Maynooth University
server.</p>
<p>The pseudonymised saliva samples each family member provides will be
sent to a university approved third-party service provider for DNA
extraction (TBC). This extracted DNA will then be sent to another
university approved third-party service provider (TBC), where they will
analyse your DNA. No genetic information resulting from this analysis
will be shared with anyone outside of the research team at Maynooth
University. After DNA extraction the third-party service provider will
be requested to return any remaining biological samples to us or provide
us with a formal destruction certificate for the samples. All saliva
samples and DNA samples will be destroyed by the Family Genomics Team by
incineration following analysis. The third-party service providers
conducting the DNA extraction and DNA analysis will not have access to
your name, address or contact information but we will send them the
biological sex of each person that provided a sample.</p>
<p>Your personal information (name, age, sex, clinical information,
address, contact details) will be stored in Maynooth University for 10
years after completion of the study. After which point we will
re-contact you (with your permission) to request permission to continue
to store your data. All other data (sensor, genetic, and questionnaire
data) will be stored in pseudonymised form (this data will only be
labelled with a unique study ID, with none of your personal information,
like your name or contact details, attached). This protects your privacy
and reduces the risk of anyone identifying participants when handling
data. This pseudonymised data will be held in Maynooth University for 10
years after completion of the study to comply with ethical guidelines.
No future uses of the data are planned but should plans arise, GDPR
requires ethical review by the Maynooth University Research Ethics
Committee and approval of same, as well as your and your family’s
consent to the specific purpose of the future use.</p>
<p>If you choose to withdraw or do not return the sensors within 6
months of the end date of the study, we will remove all of your data
from the study, including your sensor, genetic and questionnaire data.
Electronic copies of data will be overwritten, and hard copies will be
destroyed by incineration. Biological samples will be destroyed by
incineration.</p>

class="section level4">
<h4>What kind of DNA analysis will be done as part of this study?</h4>
<p>Our goal is to uncover genetic links between neurodevelopmental
conditions, sleep and circadian rhythms. We will use a method called
genome-wide genotyping to examine millions of DNA variations in each
research participant. This will help us to do an analysis called a
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), allowing us to compare these
variations both within families and between different families. While
this technique helps us understand these genetic links on a broader
level, it does not provide insights at the level of individual research
participants or specific families.</p>

<p>University approved third-party processors (TBD) will also carry out
DNA extraction from the saliva samples and will analyse the genetic
information contained in each DNA sample. They will not share this
information with anyone outside of the research team at Maynooth
University. They will not retain this information or the sample

<div id="how-will-my-privacy-and-my-childs-privacy-be-protected"
class="section level4">
<h4>How will my privacy and my child’s privacy be protected?</h4>
<p>Protecting your privacy is extremely important to all the research
team members at Maynooth University. Personal Identifiers, such as your
name or email are only used to label your questionnaires, sensor data or
saliva samples in cases where these are being posted. More specifically,
saliva samples and sensors are labelled with your names in all cases,
whereas questionnaire are only labelled with your names in cases where
these are posted to you. When this is the case, OnlineSurveys will not
have access to your questionnaire data at all. All data will be stored
on password protected files on a secure network in Maynooth University.
No one outside of the research team in Maynooth University will have
access to your contact information and all other data will be labelled
with your unique study ID, only.</p>
<p>Although all measures will be taken to protect your privacy, there is
a remote risk that a connection to your contact details could be made,
e.g., through unauthorised access to servers at Maynooth University. To
minimise this risk, any files containing these data are password
protected and have restricted access. Any attempt to identify you in
this manner would be a legal breach against the permitted use of the
research data.</p>
<p>Additionally, this study’s procedures underwent a Data Protection
Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate privacy risks. This
ensures that your personal data is handled responsibly and in compliance
with GDPR and other relevant regulations.</p>
